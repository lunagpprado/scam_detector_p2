# COP3530 Project 2 - Scam Detectors
---
## Files Needed for Program Running:
1. CSV zip files found in the data folder of the GitHub main branch.
2. "Spam Detector - Complete.zip" contains all .py files required for running the scam detection program. Also is within the GitHub main branch.

## Directories Order Needed for Functionality:
  All the CSV zip files need to be decompressed and must be within the same directory as all the .py files within "Spam Detector - Complete.zip"

## Order of Running for Full Functionality:
Now with all the files in the correct directories run the .py files in this order. (Assuming CLI is being used)
1. First run scam_detector_ml.py
2. Secondly run scam_detector_ui.py

Once the py files are ran a UI window will pop up with all the functionality featured within the video showcase.
